==================
Specifying Tallies
==================

.. currentmodule:: openmc

In order to obtain estimates of physical quantities in your simulation, you need
to create one or more tallies using the :class:`openmc.Tally` class. As
explained in detail in the :ref:`theory manual <methods_tallies>`, tallies
provide estimates of a scoring function times the flux integrated over some
region of phase space, as in:

.. math::

    X = \underbrace{\int d\mathbf{r} \int d\mathbf{\Omega} \int
    dE}_{\text{filters}} \underbrace{f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{\Omega},
    E)}_{\text{scores}} \psi (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{\Omega}, E)

Thus, to specify a tally, we need to specify what regions of phase space should
be included when deciding whether to score an event as well as what the scoring
function (:math:`f` in the above equation) should be used. The regions of phase
space are generally called *filters* and the scoring functions are simply
called *scores*.

The only cases when filters do not correspond directly with the regions of
phase space are when expansion functions are applied in the integrand, such as
for Legendre expansions of the scattering kernel.

-------
Filters
-------

To specify the regions of phase space, one must create a
:class:`openmc.Filter`. Since :class:`openmc.Filter` is an abstract class, you
actually need to instantiate one of its sub-classes (for a full listing, see
:ref:`pythonapi_tallies`). For example, to indicate that events that occur in a
given cell should score to the tally, we would create a
:class:`openmc.CellFilter`::

   cell_filter = openmc.CellFilter([fuel.id, moderator.id, reflector.id])

Another commonly used filter is :class:`openmc.EnergyFilter`, which specifies
multiple energy bins over which events should be scored. Thus, if we wanted to
tally events where the incident particle has an energy in the ranges [0 eV, 4
eV] and [4 eV, 1 MeV], we would do the following::

  energy_filter = openmc.EnergyFilter([0.0, 4.0, 1.0e6])

Energies are specified in eV and need to be monotonically increasing.

.. caution:: An energy bin between zero and the lowest energy specified is not
             included by default as it is in MCNP.

Once you have created a filter, it should be assigned to a :class:`openmc.Tally`
instance through the :attr:`Tally.filters` attribute::

  tally.filters.append(cell_filter)
  tally.filters.append(energy_filter)

  # This is equivalent
  tally.filters = [cell_filter, energy_filter]

.. note:: You are actually not required to assign any filters to a tally. If you
          create a tally with no filters, all events will score to the
          tally. This can be useful if you want to know, for example, a reaction
          rate over your entire model.

.. _usersguide_lifetime_moments:

Time Moments Since Birth
------------------------

The :class:`openmc.LifetimeMomentFilter` multiplies the scores of a tally by
the powers :math:`\tau^n`, :math:`n = 0, 1, \ldots, N`, of the time
:math:`\tau` that has elapsed since the scoring particle was born, where
:math:`N` is the order of the filter. Bin :math:`n` of the filter therefore
estimates the :math:`n`-th moment of the score with respect to the time since
birth, in units of the score multiplied by :math:`\text{s}^n`. Bin 0 is the
score itself. All bins are obtained with the same estimator from the same
events, so their statistical errors are correlated, which generally makes
ratios of bins more precise than ratios of independent tallies.

The time since birth, :math:`\tau`, is measured in seconds from the moment the
particle was started from its source site. For a source particle in a
fixed-source calculation this is the time elapsed since its emission, and the
fission neutrons transported in a fixed-source calculation are likewise
started from their fission sites. In an eigenvalue calculation, a neutron is
started from the fission site that produced it, so for a delayed neutron
:math:`\tau` counts from its emission rather than from the fission that created
its precursor.

.. note:: The time since birth is not carried over to secondary or split
   particles that continue a history. The additional neutrons of
   :math:`(n,xn)` reactions and the particles created by weight-window
   splitting restart from :math:`\tau = 0` at the collision or split that
   created them, instead of continuing from the birth of the neutron of the
   source site. This is a limitation of the implementation rather than part of
   the definition of the moments: when such reactions or weight windows are
   present, the moments of order :math:`n \ge 1` are biased low. The birth
   position and birth cell used by :class:`openmc.MeshBornFilter` and
   :class:`openmc.CellBornFilter`, and the neutron lifetime of the iterated
   fission probability method, have the same limitation.

Because the filter weight changes along a track, a tally with this filter uses
a collision estimator unless an analog estimator is requested or required by
another filter or score (for example, by an :class:`openmc.EnergyoutFilter`);
requesting a track-length estimator results in an error. A tally created at
run time through :mod:`openmc.lib` that still has the default track-length
estimator is switched to a collision estimator, with a warning, when the
simulation is initialized. Since collision and analog estimators only score at
collisions, a tally with this filter scores nothing in void regions. In surface
current tallies on a mesh (:class:`openmc.MeshSurfaceFilter`), :math:`\tau` is
the time since birth at the end of the flight that crossed the mesh surface
rather than at the crossing, as for :class:`openmc.TimeFilter`.

A typical use is to obtain fission-to-fission time moments in an eigenvalue
calculation by combining the filter with a fission production score. The
following tallies give, for each pair of mesh elements, the number of fission
neutrons produced in one element by neutrons born in another one, together
with the first and second moments of the time from the birth of the neutrons
to the production::

  born = openmc.MeshBornFilter(mesh)
  where = openmc.MeshFilter(mesh)
  moments = openmc.LifetimeMomentFilter(2)

  tally = openmc.Tally(name='fission time moments')
  tally.filters = [born, where, moments]
  tally.scores = ['nu-fission', 'prompt-nu-fission']

  delayed = openmc.Tally(name='delayed fission time moments')
  delayed.filters = [born, where,
                     openmc.DelayedGroupFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), moments]
  delayed.scores = ['delayed-nu-fission']

For each element pair, the ratio of bin 1 to bin 0 is the mean time from the
birth of a neutron to the fission neutrons it produces, and bin 2 provides the
second moment needed, for example, for the variance of that time.

.. _usersguide_delayed_group_born:

Events by Birth Delayed Group
-----------------------------

The :class:`openmc.DelayedGroupBornFilter` bins the events of a tally by the
delayed group of the source site that the scoring particle was started from.
Bin value 0 selects neutrons born prompt, and a value :math:`g \ge 1` selects
delayed neutrons emitted by precursors of delayed group :math:`g`. In an
eigenvalue calculation, the source sites of a generation are the fission sites
banked in the previous one, so the filter separates the contributions of the
prompt neutrons from those of the delayed neutrons of each precursor group::

  born_group = openmc.DelayedGroupBornFilter([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

The birth delayed group is fixed when the particle is started from its site
and does not change along the history, so the filter can be combined with any
score and any estimator. It differs from :class:`openmc.DelayedGroupFilter`,
which bins the delayed neutrons *produced* in an event by their precursor
group and is restricted to a few scores. The two filters can be combined; for
example, the following tally gives, for each pair of mesh elements, the fission
neutron production by neutrons born in one element, separately for the prompt
and each group of delayed neutrons, together with the delayed production of
each precursor group by neutrons of each birth group::

  born = openmc.MeshBornFilter(mesh)
  where = openmc.MeshFilter(mesh)

  tally = openmc.Tally(name='fission matrix by birth group')
  tally.filters = [born_group, born, where]
  tally.scores = ['nu-fission', 'prompt-nu-fission']

  delayed = openmc.Tally(name='delayed production by birth group')
  delayed.filters = [born_group, born, where,
                     openmc.DelayedGroupFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])]
  delayed.scores = ['delayed-nu-fission']

Because every source site carries exactly one delayed group, the bins of a
filter that lists all groups, from 0 to the number of delayed groups in the
data, add up to the tally without the filter.

.. note:: Particles started from sites that are not fission sites count as
   born prompt (group 0). Besides external source particles, these are the
   additional neutrons of :math:`(n,xn)` reactions and the particles created
   by weight-window splitting, which restart from a site at the collision or
   split that created them instead of keeping the delayed group of the
   neutron of the source site. This is a limitation of the implementation,
   shared with the birth position and birth cell used by
   :class:`openmc.MeshBornFilter` and :class:`openmc.CellBornFilter` and with
   the time since birth used by :class:`openmc.LifetimeMomentFilter`: when
   such reactions or weight windows are present, the contributions of the
   secondary and split particles of a delayed neutron are moved to the prompt
   bin. A fixed-source calculation that starts from a source file of fission
   sites, or that transports fission neutrons, uses the delayed groups of
   those sites.

.. _usersguide_scores:

------
Scores
------

To specify the scoring functions, a list of strings needs to be given to the
:attr:`Tally.scores` attribute. You can score the flux ('flux'), or a reaction
rate ('total', 'fission', etc.). For example, to tally the elastic scattering
rate and the fission neutron production, you'd assign::

  tally.scores = ['elastic', 'nu-fission']

With no further specification, you will get the total elastic scattering rate
and the total fission neutron production. If you want reaction rates for a
particular nuclide or set of nuclides, you can set the :attr:`Tally.nuclides`
attribute to a list of strings indicating which nuclides. The nuclide names
should follow the same :ref:`naming convention <usersguide_naming>` as that used
for material specification. If we wanted the reaction rates only for U235 and
U238 (separately), we'd set::

  tally.nuclides = ['U235', 'U238']

You can also list 'all' as a nuclide which will give you a separate reaction
rate for every nuclide in the model.

The following tables show all valid scores:

-----------------
Virtual Materials
-----------------

Reaction-rate scores normally include the atom densities of the materials in the
model. Setting :attr:`Tally.multiply_density` to ``False`` instead produces
microscopic, nuclide-wise results. After a simulation, densities from a *virtual
material* can be applied to these results with
:meth:`Tally.apply_virtual_material`. This is useful for determining the
response of a material that is not actually present in the transport model.

For example, the absorbed dose in silicon can be calculated in a region that
does not contain silicon as follows. In this example, ``dose_cell`` identifies
the region of interest that has its volume set in cm³.

::

    silicon = openmc.Material(name='virtual silicon')
    silicon.add_element('Si', 1.0)
    silicon.set_density('g/cm3', 2.329)

    tally = openmc.Tally(name='silicon heating')
    tally.filters = [openmc.CellFilter(dose_cell)]
    tally.scores = ['heating']
    tally.nuclides = silicon.get_nuclides()
    tally.multiply_density = False

    model.tallies = [tally]
    model.run(apply_tally_results=True)

    # Apply the silicon atom densities without collapsing the nuclide axis
    tally.apply_virtual_material(silicon)

    # Sum over nuclides and convert deposited energy to dose
    eV_per_source = tally.mean.sum()
    J_per_source = eV_per_source * openmc.data.JOULE_PER_EV
    J_per_cm3_source = J_per_source / dose_cell.volume
    kg_per_cm3 = silicon.get_mass_density() * 1.0e-3
    Gy_per_source = J_per_cm3_source / kg_per_cm3

Before the virtual material is applied, the nuclide-wise heating results have
units of eV-b-cm/(atom-source). Multiplication by atom densities in atom/b-cm
gives eV/source while retaining the nuclide dimension. The explicit sum above
combines the nuclide contributions. Finally, dividing the deposited energy in
joules by the virtual silicon mass in kilograms gives absorbed dose in
Gy/source.

The tally must contain individual nuclide bins; a ``'total'`` nuclide bin cannot
be used because a material density cannot be assigned to its constituent
nuclides. Tally nuclides that do not occur in the virtual material are treated
as having zero atom density.

.. _usersguide_tally_normalization:

------------------------------
Normalization of Tally Results
------------------------------

As described in :ref:`usersguide_scores`, all tally scores are normalized per
source particle simulated. However, for analysis of a given system, we usually
want tally scores in a more natural unit. For example, neutron flux is often
reported in units of particles/cm\ :sup:`2`\ -s. For a fixed source simulation,
it is usually straightforward to convert units if the source rate is known. For
example, if the system being modeled includes a source that is emitting 10\
:sup:`4` neutrons per second, the tally results just need to be multipled by 10\
:sup:`4`. This can either be done manually or using the
:attr:`openmc.SourceBase.strength` attribute.

For a :math:`k`\ -eigenvalue calculation, normalizing tally results is not as
simple because the source rate is not actually known. Instead, we typically know
the system power, :math:`P`, which represents how much energy is deposited per
unit time. Most of this energy originates from fission, but a small percentage
also results from other reactions (e.g., photons emitted from :math:`(n,\gamma)`
reactions). The most rigorous method to normalize tally results is to run a
coupled neutron-photon calculation and tally the ``heating`` score over the
entire system. This score provides the heating rate in units of [eV/source],
which we'll denote :math:`H`. Then, calculate the heating rate in J/source as

.. math::

    H' = 1.602\times10^{-19} \left [ \frac{\text{J}}{\text{eV}} \right ] \cdot H
    \left [\frac{\text{eV}}{\text{source}} \right ].

Dividing the power by the observed heating rate then gives us a normalization
factor that can be applied to other tallies:

.. math::

    f = \frac{P}{H'} = \frac{[\text{J}/\text{s}]}{[\text{J}/\text{source}]} =
    \left [ \frac{\text{source}}{\text{s}} \right ].

Multiplying by the normalization factor and dividing by volume, we can then get
the flux in typical units:

.. math::

    \phi' = \frac{f\phi}{V} =
    \frac{[\text{source}/\text{s}][\text{particle-cm}/\text{source}]}
    {[\text{cm}^3]} = \left [\frac{\text{particle}}{\text{cm}^2\cdot\text{s}}
    \right ]

There are several slight variations on this procedure:

- Run a neutron-only calculation and estimate the total heating using the
  ``heating-local`` score (this requires that your nuclear data has local
  heating data available, such as in the official data library at
  https://openmc.org. See :ref:`methods_heating` for more information.)
- Run a neutron-only calculation and use the ``kappa-fission`` or
  ``fission-q-recoverable`` scores along with an estimate of the extra heating
  due to neutron capture reactions.
- Calculate the overall fission rate and then used a fixed Q value to estimate
  the heating rate.

Note that the only difference between these and the above procedures is in how
:math:`H'` is estimated.
